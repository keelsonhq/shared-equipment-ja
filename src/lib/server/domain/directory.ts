// looked up from the cached member index every time a person is displayed,
// never written to the database (people who left have none).
//
// Locally (`pnpm dev`) the directory is `keelson dev serve`'s mock, or the
// identity SDK's local mode, both serving the local roster
// (seed-data/dev-users.json). The app itself never has sample people.
